# ArduinoProjs

### Endurance tester 
Generates Prime number in sequential order, with exponential increase in complexity as the number increases: which corresponds correctly to find practical differences between configurations of seperate mcu chips. The serial output is a bottleneck for the starting numbers, so the program is set to output result only after a particular time, and not after evey calculation.The program resets and starts again after running for about 50 days (theoretically)
